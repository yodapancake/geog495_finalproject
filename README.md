# Future Seattle Zoning Plans 2035

## Project Description 
For my **Geog495** final project I built a webgis application that shows you the future land use plans for the city of Seattle that are to be implemented by 2035, and the different colors represent different zoning designations. I also included a search bar at the top for people to look up different locations and drop a pin on that location. The goal of my project is to show people how Seattle might be changing over the next few years and to see what might be happening to locations they are familiar with. For example, some parks are being removed or reduced in order to make space for more housing. One issue with the data is that sometimes cities designate areas with multiple zoning designations and in the data this causes the polygons to overlap which causes these areas to become weird colors not in the color key because the polygons are colored with an amount of opacity. To compensate for this, I also included borders for each polygon so that people can distsniguish area from one anaother and you cam also click on any areas to pop up anm information box that tells you what the area is designated for.
